# React-PDF
A react class for implementing a localized, and source code editable version of docusign

I originally created this class for a project using a MERN stack, embedded within a custom CRM system I wrote. This software didn't exist outside of paid black box subscription models, and none of those functioned in a way I would expect. I uploaded this class in the hopes it will benefit others. It's original state is made for the context it was designed but could easily be reformatted to suite other needs. Eventually I'll refractor the code to make it a generic class, suitable for drop-ins on other projects.

The module was designed to both pull from and save to a database using base64 encoding. When it fetches the pdf, the system is designed to use customer generated pdf, but the titles have been modified by the database creator to matches db fields. For instance, you have a sales quote pdf when you contact new customers. The database may have First Name, Last Name, Address, etc. On the PDF form the customer creates, you create a text field for said data with the context `{"First Name": "[value]"}`, ie a json formatted set of data for the said field. The saved data function in the end integrates with mailgun for sending a pdf copy of the form, saves the new pdf filled in for base64, ready to be saved in the customer database, as well as the field information to update, or save new customer information.
